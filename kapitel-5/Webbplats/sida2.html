        <p>Cigarettes After Sex is an American dream pop band, formed in El Paso, Texas, in 2008 by Greg Gonzalez. The band
            is known for their ethereal, limerent and often dream-like musical style, lyrics often based on the themes of
            romance and love, as well as Gonzalez's voice, which has been described as "androgynous".[8] While marketed as
            an ambient pop band, Cigarettes After Sex are also considered to be shoegaze, slowcore and indie rock.
            
            The band's debut extended play (EP), I., was released in 2012, with the song "Nothing's Gonna Hurt You Baby"
            eventually becoming a sleeper hit through commercial licensing. After the release of the standalone single
            "Affection" in 2015, the band released their self-titled debut studio album in 2017 to positive reviews. The
            second Cigarettes After Sex studio album, Cry, followed in 2019. The band's third album, X's, was released on
            July 12, 2024.</p>
            <p>Cigarettes After Sex was formed in El Paso, Texas, by Greg Gonzalez in 2008.[9][10][8] Gonzalez recorded the
                first EP, I., in a four-story stairway at his alma mater, University of Texas at El Paso, calling the experience
                "basically an accident; kind of an experiment".[8]
                
                According to Gonzalez, he had a "friendship with certain benefits" with a woman who smoked after they were
                together, and one night the name popped into his head.[11] Mitali Shah of Harper's Bazaar India considers the
                name "extremely catchy",[12] while Sarah Kidd writing for Ambient Light Blog calls it "the name that you just
                can't forget".</p>
