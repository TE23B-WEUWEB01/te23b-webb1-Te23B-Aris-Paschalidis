            <p>One of the STS-103 astronauts inside Discovery's cabin took this image of the full moon backdropped
                against the blackness of space over Earth's horizon. The top of the berthed Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
                appears in the frame.

            <p>NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) recently captured a unique view of Earth from the spacecraft's
                vantage point in orbit around the moon. "The image is simply stunning," said Noah Petro, Deputy Project
                Scientist for LRO at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. "The image of the Earth
                evokes the famous 'Blue Marble' image taken by Astronaut Harrison Schmitt during Apollo 17, 43 years
                ago, which also showed Africa prominently in the picture." In this composite image we see Earth appear
                to rise over the lunar horizon from the viewpoint of the spacecraft, with the center of the Earth just
                off the coast of Liberia (at 4.04 degrees North, 12.44 degrees West). The large tan area in the upper
                right is the Sahara Desert, and just beyond is Saudi Arabia. The Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South
                America are visible to the left. On the moon, we get a glimpse of the crater Compton, which is located
                just beyond the eastern limb of the moon, on the lunar farside. LRO was launched on June 18, 2009, and
                has collected a treasure trove of data with its seven powerful instruments, making an invaluable
                contribution to our knowledge about the moon. LRO experiences 12 earthrises every day; however the
                spacecraft is almost always busy imaging the lunar surface so only rarely does an opportunity arise such
                that its camera instrument can capture a view of Earth. Occasionally LRO points off into space to
                acquire observations of the extremely thin lunar atmosphere and perform instrument calibration
                measurements. During these movements sometimes Earth (and other planets) pass through the camera's field
                of view and dramatic images such as the one shown here are acquired. This image was composed from a
                series of images taken Oct. 12, when LRO was about 83 miles (134 kilometers) above the moon's farside
                crater Compton. Capturing an image of the Earth and moon with LRO's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera
                (LROC) instrument is a complicated task. First the spacecraft must be rolled to the side (in this case
                67 degrees), then the spacecraft slews with the direction of travel to maximize the width of the lunar
                horizon in LROC's Narrow Angle Camera image. All this takes place while LRO is traveling faster than
                3,580 miles per hour (over 1,600 meters per second) relative to the lunar surface below the spacecraft!
                The high-resolution Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) on LRO takes black-and-white images, while the lower
                resolution Wide Angle Camera (WAC) takes color images, so you might wonder how we got a high-resolution
                picture of the Earth in color. Since the spacecraft, Earth, and moon are all in motion, we had to do
                some special processing to create an image that represents the view of the Earth and moon at one
                particular time. The final Earth image contains both WAC and NAC information. WAC provides the color,
                and the NAC provides high-resolution detail. "From the Earth, the daily moonrise and moonset are always
                inspiring moments," said Mark Robinson of Arizona State University in Tempe, principal investigator for
                LROC. "However, lunar astronauts will see something very different: viewed from the lunar surface, the
                Earth never rises or sets. Since the moon is tidally locked, Earth is always in the same spot above the
                horizon, varying only a small amount with the slight wobble of the moon. The Earth may not move across
                the 'sky', but the view is not static. Future astronauts will see the continents rotate in and out of
                view and the ever-changing pattern of clouds will always catch one's eye, at least on the nearside. The
                Earth is never visible from the farside; imagine a sky with no Earth or moon - what will farside
                explorers think with no Earth overhead?" NASA's first Earthrise image was taken with the Lunar Orbiter 1
                spacecraft in 1966. Perhaps NASA's most iconic Earthrise photo was taken by the crew of the Apollo 8
                mission as the spacecraft entered lunar orbit on Christmas Eve Dec. 24, 1968. That evening, the
                astronauts -- Commander Frank Borman, Command Module Pilot Jim Lovell, and Lunar Module Pilot William
                Anders -- held a live broadcast from lunar orbit, in which they showed pictures of the Earth and moon as
                seen from their spacecraft. Said Lovell, "The vast loneliness is awe-inspiring and it makes you realize
                just what you have back there on Earth.

                by the Sun and the rugged lunar limb topography allows beads of sunlight to shine through in some areas

            <p>The second manned lunar landing mission, Apollo 12 launched from launch pad 39-A at Kennedy Space Center
                in Florida on November 14, 1969 via a Saturn Five launch vehicle. The Saturn V vehicle was developed by
                the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) under the direction of Dr. Wernher von Braun. Aboard Apollo 12
                was a crew of three astronauts: Alan L. Bean, pilot of the Lunar Module (LM), Intrepid; Richard Gordon,
                pilot of the Command Module (CM), Yankee Clipper; and Spacecraft Commander Charles Conrad. The LM,
                Intrepid, landed astronauts Conrad and Bean on the lunar surface in what’s known as the Ocean of Storms
                while astronaut Richard Gordon piloted the CM, Yankee Clipper, in a parking orbit around the Moon. Their
                lunar soil activities included the deployment of the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP),
                finding the unmanned Surveyor 3 that landed on the Moon on April 19, 1967, and collecting 75 pounds (34
                kilograms) of rock samples. In this photograph, one of the astronauts on the Moon’s surface is holding a
                container of lunar soil. The other astronaut is seen reflected in his helmet. Apollo 12 safely returned
                to Earth on November 24, 1969.
